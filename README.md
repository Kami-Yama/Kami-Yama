- Hi! My online name is `Kami-Yama` and I am a Developer (good or bad is up to you)

1. Managing the dev work in the Minecraft server of **KibeliusDaVivere**.

2. Studying Japanese in the free time

3. Costantly learning new stuff about IT

4. Currently studying Information Technology (IT) in Valdagno, Italy (IIS Marzotto-Luzzati, 5th year)

- `My knowledge`

1. Experience in **Standard Web Developing**, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. I'm better as a Back-End Developer, as I have yet to learn Angular, React and Node.js. They are on my bucket list though

2. Experience in **Software Developing**, using C#, Java, C++, C. I have yet to learn using C++ in a good way. I am the most confident with C#, but I'm eager to learn Python and a lot more

3. Experience in Cryptography and Networks. I have successfully pursued the Cisco Networking Academy course and I've studied the most relevant aspects of Cryptography and Cyber Security (Cripthography algorithms, simmetric algrorithms, assymetric algorithms, key interchange etc...)
