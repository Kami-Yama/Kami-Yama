Hi! My online name is `Kami-Yama` and I am a Developer (good or bad is up to you)

1. Studying Japanese in the free time

2. Costantly learning new stuff about IT

- `My knowledge`

1. Experience in **Standard Web Developing**, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. I'm better as a Back-End Developer, as I have yet to learn Angular, React and Node.js. They are on my bucket list though
